# Responsive Columns

Create an HTML page (index.html) and a stylesheet (style.css). You will need to create the necessary elements in your HTML and add rules to your style.css file to make your page look like the example image.

Try creating the page using the mobile first concept, where both pages will be 100% of the screen width.

From here your media queries come in, transforming the element and leaving the `<section>` tag with `70%` of the screen width and the aside tag with the rest.

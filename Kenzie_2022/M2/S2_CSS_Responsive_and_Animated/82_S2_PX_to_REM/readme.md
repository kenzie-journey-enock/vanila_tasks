# S2 PX to REM

In this activity we will practice refactoring an existing project, adjusting the values of CSS properties that are in pixels to rem.

The application we will refactor is the one made at [72_S1_Structuring_the_front](M2/S1_CSS_Good_Practices_and_Layout/72_S1_Structuring_the_front), where we apply good CSS practices and organize the code.

Your task in this activity will be to change all visual size values in the standard pixels and change them to rem, thus ensuring accessibility in the relative size proportion. Note that you will not have to do this conversion only in texts, but in the sizes of elements as well, ensuring that all elements are in harmony in size proportion.

This exercise helped us put into practice the conversion of pixel values to rem, so we can, through practice, create the habit of applying the values in our project in a pattern.

## Formula

value in REM = value in pixels / font size of root element in pixels

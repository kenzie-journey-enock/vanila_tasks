    <h3>Status Rasponsive CSS: </h3>
    <p>Media queries are an important feature of CSS that allow you to adapt the appearance of a website or application based on the size and capabilities of the device on which it is being displayed. With media queries, it is possible to apply different styles according to screen width, resolution, orientation (landscape or portrait), support for features such as touch screen or even whether the device is mobile or desktop. This technique is essential for creating a responsive design, ensuring that content is viewed in the best possible way on different devices.</p>
    <p>By using media queries, you can create specific CSS rules for different screen sizes, which allows you to dynamically adjust the layout and style to improve the user experience. For example, when reaching a certain screen width, you can change the position of elements, adjust the font size, hide or display certain elements and even rearrange the content to make it more suitable for the available space. Media queries make it possible to create versatile and adaptable designs, ensuring that users can access the content of a website or application comfortably and efficiently, regardless of the device they are using.</p>

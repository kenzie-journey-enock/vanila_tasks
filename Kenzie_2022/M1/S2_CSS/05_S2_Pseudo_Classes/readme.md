# Pseudo Classes

## Objective

You have been invited to participate in a project.
Its main objective is to reproduce the layout of a card, which will be inserted on the client's blog page.

The layout is very simple and you believe you will be able to create it without problems using the hover pseudo-class for the effects and the margin, padding and border properties to align the elements.

The contractor learned that you are very good with semantic tags and he believes that the card would be better if he used this concept, as he head somewhere that it improves the site's performance and accessibility for screen readers.

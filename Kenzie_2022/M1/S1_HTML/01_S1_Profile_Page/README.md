This delivery was developed to practice the use of semantic tags and HTML syntax. Now you know that you can wrap tags around others and get great results when building a project or web application.

## Goals

### 1) The body of the document must have an article covering all the content you will develop in this delivery;

### 2) The article begins with a header that will involve a level one title (main title) and a paragraph:
  - The level one title must contain your name;
  - The paragraph should tell a little about you and contain an external link to another website;

### 3) After the header comes the first section:
  - The first section must have a level two title that contains the text "My Favorite Social Networks";
  - and an unordered list of your favorite social networks;

### 4) Create another section:
  - The second section should have a level two title that contains the text "My goals at Kenzie";
  - and an ordered list that contains your objectives;
